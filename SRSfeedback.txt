Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Strengths
      Components clearly separated by responsibility.
      High-level diagram clarifies interactions.
   Suggestions
      Components could be decomposed further into submodules (CSUs).
      A rationale for each component boundary would improve completeness.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Broad coverage of major user‑facing behaviors.
      Requirements are consistently structured and externally testable.
   Suggestions
      Some functions could benefit from quantification (e.g., limits on
         saved items, max Stacks per user).
      Missing edge-case behaviors (e.g., how missing data, broken catalog
         links, or empty search results are handled).
      Could add admin or maintenance requirements if relevant.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Requirements are measurable and observable.
      Cover both speed and concurrency.
   Suggestions
      Could define quantitative limits on concurrency (e.g., expected max
         number of simultaneous users).
      Could define availability, uptime, or scalability expectations.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Clearly states hardware/software assumptions.
      Realistic for a web application.
   Suggestions
      Could describe backend hosting environment (cloud provider, OS,
         database engine).
      Could specify required API endpoints and external dependency behavior.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown               1.0/1
   Functional Requirements           3.6/4
   Performance Requirements          2.0/2
   Environment Requirements          1.0/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                          7.6/8
   Preliminary Schedule              2.0/2
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   9.6/10 = 96% which is an A

You've met most of the desired measurements for this deliverable.  Your SRS
is very well done but could benefit from at least incorporating a few of
the suggestions to make it even more complete, such as some of the suggested
items in the Functional and Performance sections.

Nice work on this deliverable ~ keep up the good work!
