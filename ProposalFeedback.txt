VIDEO EVALUATION
================
Very nice work, Hannah!  I like the graphics in the presentation.  You have
the right amount of text coupled with the graphics.  You seem to be mostly
talking from your knowledge of the project rather than reading from a script
and it's very engaging that way!  I like your prom dress example!  You have
a great motivation, too!

Nice job on this.  Four out of Five points on this deliverable.
