=================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 5.1 ~ correct

Problem 5.2 ~ A monolithic or simple layered/MVC architecture would be the
   more typical rationale here; “component-based” is not wrong, but the
   answer would benefit from justification (why components over monolith)

Problem 5.4 ~ correct

Problem 5.6 ~ correct

Problem 5.8 ~  ASCII art is marginally acceptable.  Download and install an
   actual drawing program and embed your diagrams from now on for a more
   professional presentation of your work.

Problem 6.1 ~ a couple of debatable choices (e.g., “rotation” for line/star
   only—rectangle/ellipse often rotate too) and lack of exact property
   typing/visibility.

Problem 6.2 ~ See comment on 5.8.  The hierarchy matches the 6.1 write-up
   and is readable.  Deductions for a few gaps (e.g., where line style/dash
   properties live, whether rectangle/ellipse also have width/height in the
   diagram, and some layout/label clarity).


nice work!
