=================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 1.1 ~ This covers much of the lifecycle but omits deployment and
   wrap-up/retrospective, and doesn’t distinguish high- vs. low-level design.
   Good start but not fully complete.

Problem 1.2 ~ since deployment and wrap-up weren’t included in 1.1, they’re
   also not addressed here, leaving the description set incomplete

Problem 2.4 ~ correct

Problem 2.5 ~ correct

Problem 4.2 ~ critical path should be either H, I, D, E, M, Q or G, D, E, M, Q
   for a total of 32 days.

Problem 4.4 ~ table is provided for the stated critical path, but it doesn’t
   demonstrate weekend/holiday skips and the date ranges appear to include
   weekends.  Also, not a Gantt chart.

Problem 4.6 ~ correct

Problem 4.8 ~ The textbook’s two biggest mistakes are typically (1) adding
   people to a late task (Brooks’s Law) and (2) ignoring lost time assuming
   you can make it up later; these aren’t captured here.

Problem 5.1 ~ correct

Problem 5.3 ~ The submission splits into User vs. System only, which doesn’t
   map cleanly to the requested taxonomy and leads to several
   misclassifications.

Problem 5.9 ~ correct


nice work!
